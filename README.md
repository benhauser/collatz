Simple, brute force [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) tester in JavaScript.

After running for a couple of days this was the output:

So I can confirm the conjecture holds up to 17 billion (1.7 x 10^10) or so. This conjecture has been checked up to [2.36 Ã— 10^21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#cite_note-Barina-13) so I've only redone the first 10^11th of that. That is, the first 100 billionth. Geesh.
